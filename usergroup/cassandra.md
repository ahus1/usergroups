# Cassandra Frankfurt
![Cassandra Frankfurt](./cassandra.logo.jpg)

The Apache Cassandra Project develops a highly scalable second-generation distributed database,
bringing together Dynamo's fully distributed design and Bigtable's ColumnFamily-based data model. The Frankfurt
Apache Cassandra User Group is a highly awesome meetup group, bringing together cool people distributed across
Frankfurt to talk about our favorite NoSQL implementation, Apache Cassandra.
